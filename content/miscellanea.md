# Sites I find interesting
- [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/), author of the books _The Visual Display of
Quantitative Information_, _Envisioning Information_, _Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities,
Evidence and Narrative_, _Beautiful Evidence_, and _Seeing with Fresh Eyes: Meaning, Space, Data, Truth_. 
These books single-handedly enamored me with statistics and data visualization, in particular with the 
elegance and clarity of well-communicated data. I cannot recommend these enough. 

# Resources
As an undergraduate in mathematics and former course TA, I have spent much free
time thinking about good resources to learn mathematics, computer science, and
plenty of other things. I think I would like to teach at some point in my life if
the opportunity presents itself. Some of the resources I've found helpful or used
are linked below.
- [An Infinite Descent into Pure Mathematics](https://infinitedescent.xyz/) by Clive Newstead. 
This is the standard text from which Carnegie Mellon teaches its introduction to proof based
mathematics course. It has plenty of exercises and in my view, is a great starting point for
someone with an interest in proof based math.
- [Mathematics In Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) by
Jeremy Avigad and Patrick Massot. This is the text which we loosely followed in the course
on Interactive Theorem Proving I took with professor Avigad. I was in a bad place mentally
when I took the course which led me to not putting in enough effort, which I sorely regret.
Professor Avigad is great and very passionate about the subject matter.
