# Sites I find interesting
- [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/), author of the books _The Visual Display of
Quantitative Information_, _Envisioning Information_, _Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities,
Evidence and Narrative_, _Beautiful Evidence_, and _Seeing with Fresh Eyes: Meaning, Space, Data, Truth_. 
These books single-handedly enamored me with statistics and data visualization, in particular with the 
elegance and clarity of well-communicated data. I cannot recommend these enough.
