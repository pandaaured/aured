I am a student studying Mathematics and Computer Science at 
[Carnegie Mellon University.](https://www.cmu.edu/).

I enjoy learning in any discipline. My specialty is technical, but I have a fond
appreciation for the humanities and my experiences growing up reading books and 
loving history. I grew up speaking English and Spanish natively, I learned 
French in middle and high school, and I learned a little bit of Swedish on my own
time. As for technical things, I have experience using C, Rust, SML, 
Python, Lean 4, LaTeX, Typst, HTML, CSS, and a variety of other languages. I am 
fondest of SML and Rust for programming things; Rust for its performance and 
ecosystem, SML for its elegant syntax and distinct approach to the writing of 
programs. My first experience with typesetting was LaTeX in 2015 and my first 
experience with programming was with Python in 2023. 

I run one version of each major operating system: my desktop dualboots Windows 
11 and Arch Linux, though I spend more time on my Windows 11 install because it 
is a bit easier on me (at least for now). My laptop runs macOS 15. 

I know people can be cargo-culty about editors, but I try my best to use 
something that lets me get work done since I know that if I were to care enough, 
the amount of time saved in some tasks would be nullified by the amount of time 
spent fidgeting and getting <1% performance increases. Anyway, I use:
- Visual Studio Code as a general purpose editor (mostly for Rust at this point)
- Neovim as a general purpose editor (I am still learning the keybindings and 
gradually getting better at using them. I am finding it more and more fun by 
the day!)
