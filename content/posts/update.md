Hello!

I am sorry about the four month gap between posts. Once I began writing my
post about the trip I took to New York City and Washington D.C., I found that
I had contracted a common disease: poster's block. I could not come up with a
working idea for what I wanted the scope of my post to be; it oscillated between
trip summary, photo catalog, general thoughts, but mostly some unsightly linear
combination of the three. I should probably not take these formatting and content
choices too seriously, since this is a personal site, but I have an urge to write
well whenever possible.

# Where have I been?
I've been extremely busy! I registered for two difficult core CS classes this
semester and I am in the "finding out" stage, as the kids say. (I'm 22 at the 
time of writing, I can say this). The semester has been very hectic--I've gotten
accustomed to 12+ hour days on campus and camping at office hours for extended
periods, but I've made friends in my classes and the camaraderie makes it feel
worthwhile in the end.

# Why am I posting?
I'm on fall break! Mercifully, we don't have to work non-stop from the end of
August through to November. I've used my time off to relax a bit and catch up on 
some bookkeeping and note organization. But mostly sleep. Lots of sleep.

I like writing! This much should be apparent if you know anything about my background
and family history :)

I want my website to feel more alive and personal! I've been growing more and more
dissatisfied with the state of the internet, particularly with the prevalence of social
media as a primary (and often only) source of interaction between people. I appreciate
personal sites because they offer more biographical information about someone, as opposed to
timeline-based media, which are not as well suited for this purpose. I like getting to 
know people, and personal sites are great for this. Why not contribute? (Rhetorical, 
directed towards myself)

# Have I done anything fun?
Yeah! I've gotten into a more consistent gym routine during the semester.

I've also explored the city in my downtime, as usual. I discovered there's a mall
at the end of the Red/Blue Lines??? I've ridden plenty of the new 2025 New Flyer XD40s
that PRT has started rolling out quite regularly. I also visited the site of the East Busway
photoshoot for memories' sake. I miss the furries.

# Will I post again soon?
I genuinely don't know! I would like to finish up that NYC trip update post,
but over break we were assigned malloclab, a notoriously time-consumming 
assignment.

Thanks for reading! I hope to be writing again soon
Aured
