Happy 6/21! :3 

Over the past week, I have gotten quite a bit of work done on my panel for Anthrocon.

Much of that work consisted of dry runs: taking the P1 from the stop in front of the
Westin hotel to East Liberty station, timing each stop, measuring "capacity". It occured
to me that if any significant fraction of the 140 (!) people who registered for our panel
wanted to participate in the ride-along, it would be logistically difficult to accommodate.
Pittsburgh's weather is also a factor to consider: last year, I saw someone suffer heatstroke
in the registration line. It has been hot and humid recently. Should we discourage fursuiting 
on the trip?

I have also done work on my slides for the presentation, I know roughly what topics I am
going to cover: I just need to add more flourishes and hooks so that the presentation is
maximally engaging. I know what topics my groupmates seek to address, but I won't talk 
about that here (spoilers).

I wonder if we'll break 150 registered attendees, and if so, how many will show up to the 
panel itself.
