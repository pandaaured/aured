On July 4th, I finally was able to realize the event I had been building
toward for the last month: I hosted the Transit and Furbanism panel at 
Anthrocon 2025. Alongside me was [Nick](https://wah.blue), [Teg](https://tegfox.blue/),
and [Kezl](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsc_Lpk6dva2Lk4zSBWeuLA). 
The talk had 374 registered attendees on Sched and the room was at, if 
not considerably beyond, the seating capacity for the venue. The panel 
lost very few attendees as it progressed.

# An overview of the presentation
The talk consisted of four main sections:
+ Transit in Pittsburgh (me): I gave a brief overview of Pittsburgh as a city
of industry, discussed its declining population since 1960 and furshadowed (:3) the 
effects it will have on transit.  

+ Furry Civic Pride (Nick): Nick gave a point of comparison between several cities.
Lastly, the example of MFF was brought up and contrasted with Anthrocon. Anthrocon 
is held in the center of a city with many urban amenities and more robust infrastructure, 
whereas MFF is held in Rosemont, where it is a chore to get to the convention center from 
a hotel that isn't main (allegedly, I haven't been).

+ Urbanism and the Fandom (Teg): Teg outlined three important factors for why urbanism
and the fandom can complement each other. They are (1) access and mobility (taking an Uber 
to the convention center or to get food sucks!), (2) access to local businesses as opposed to chains, 
and (3) community and culture. (Tangentially, there is a lot of potential in this section to 
mention things like antisocial behaviors). This section also ended with a leading question 
which set up the following section: "

+ Furry Planning for Accessibility (Kezl):
Kezl gave an account of personal experiences with transit meets being inaccessible
by transit in both St. Louis and Cleveland. It turns out that the alienating experience 
of living without a car as a college student and trying to participate in events that are
not accessible is one that causes great dismay among many people, not just transit 
enthusiasts. True to "be the change you seek", Kezl helped create transit oriented furmeets
in Cleveland, Ohio, a city with 6% transit mode share. Further, as of now, there is a much
greater proportion of transit accessible furmeets and the rate of transit use to go to these
meets is at 20%, which is ~3x the modeshare of public transit overall in Cleveland.

# The ride-along
After the event, we walked a large group of people from room 316 in the DLLCC 
to Penn Station on the East Busway! This was by far the most chaotic part of 
the whole trip: around 60-80 people walked across the third floor of the
convention center, down two escalator, and through the loading area to Liberty 
Ave, turning left and crossing the street at Grant Ave. This is the part of the 
panel that I think has the most room for improvement; the capacity of the group
made it difficult to manage without use of radios until being outside of the center.
Once we got to Penn Station, there was a slight hiccup with which direction to turn 
at the station crosswalk. Aside from that, everything went very well. Nobody had
trouble paying their fare and the weather mercifully cooled down when we needed it to.

# Post Convention Panel Thoughts
Anthrocon 2025 was an astounding success from a goal perspective. The panel was 
a success, the ride-along was a success, and I had plenty of interactions that were 
transit adjacent throughout the whole convention. I now want to ask myself what I
can do that is more novel than this panel, since I know that many people will be 
going to a transit panel as repeat attendees. I will strive to find engaging and
informative topics that remain accessible and interesting to a general audience. 

We rehearsed the entire presentation the night before we held it! Perhaps this is too 
much effort for a furry convention panel, but I like doing things that I'm passionate about 
well. I almost had us rehearse the route from the room to the outside of the convention
center, but it was late at night the day before. Also, we did not have a crowd of people
to practice moving between places. So, there was likely not much else we were able to do there. 

# Post Convention General Thoughts
This was my favorite Anthrocon to date! I did more than I have done at any prior 
Anthrocon, I went to more panels (the Data Structures and Algorithms panel was really
fun!), I participated in more panels (had to represent at the University Furs panel),
and I hung out with friends much more than at previous conventions. Of course, it wasn't
perfect, and there is always more I can do to make the next convention better.

Thank you so much for making this event great!
