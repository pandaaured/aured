      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently informed that the panel proposal I submitted for this year&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;Anthrocon has been accepted. Great! After the last two years, I am happy that&#xA;the panel is going to be official this time and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what the&#xA;turnout is like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the subject of the panel, I have thoughts about what I want to talk about.&#xA;As of June 1st, I am the only Pittsburgh resident on the panel. As such, I know a lot of&#xA;operational things about the system and would be the best equipped to explain its&#xA;usage. Aside from this, I am contemplating writing about some of Pittsburgh&amp;rsquo;s history&#xA;to illustrate how transit evolved to its current form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first post on this site. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am setting up this site as a place for some of my thoughts, writings, and&#xA;notes on various things. I intend to keep this site more up-to-date than I have&#xA;my previous attempts at sites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
